<h1><div align="center"> Liovirgilda Mendonca </div></h1>

I am a passionate <strong>software developer</strong> who recently graduated from a 16-week, full-time Bootcamp provided by <strong>Makers Academy</strong>.   

My love for tech started in university when I learnt the basics of <strong>Java</strong>, and I have been looking for ways to explore this area more.  

The ability to write different code to solve a single problem has improved my <strong>critical thinking</strong> and stretched my comfort zone, which reminds me a lot when I was studying <strong>Mathematics</strong>.   

Throughout the course, I learned how to write reusable and clean code with the help of <strong>TDD</strong> practices, organise a group project using <strong>Agile methodology</strong> and <strong>communicate effectively</strong> during <strong>pair-programming </strong>sessions.
